Customizing UX Products
=======================

Rocket Lawyer UX Products are built with the Rocket Lawyer Foundation Design System. Our design system supports a number of parameters that can be used to customize the look and feel of your apps to express your brand. This guide will describe the process of updating the branding in your app(s) and each of the supported parameters.

Updating your apps
------------------

Out of the box, your apps will express a generic "Logo Ipsum" brand. To update the look and feel of the UX product, you will need to complete this form. This will queue the update to be applied by our customer support team. Your update should be applied within 24 hours. You will be notified once it has.

Your Logo
---------

Your logo is rendered in the header of emails that are sent by our API Products. We need you to provide a large png image (~1024px wide). Usually the logo is wider than it is tall. Ideally it has a transparent background. We will render it to the dimensions required by our latest email template designs. Here is an example.
